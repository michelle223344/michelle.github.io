		<p> <font color = "#e0e5e5"> Hi, Im Michelle. I graduated from LaGuardia Highschool in New York City. In highschool, I majored in art and now Im majoring in pharmacy. Most of my friends stayed in the city and went to conservatories, while I decided to take on a different path in life. So far, Buffalo is very different from New York City, but I'll eventually get used to it. My dream job would be a pharmacist and to open up my own chain of pharmacies later on in my career-life. I would also try to incorporate art into my life as much as possible because I think its a nice skill to have in life.   </font> </p>
